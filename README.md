## Source notes

Sources where license is not clear: OPUS (O?), Beyond (B?), CommonCrawl (C?), wolk_marasek_building_2014, el-kishky-etal-2021-xlent, emnlp-2020-main, NODALIDA 2017, reimers-gurevych-2020-making

Sources that are not free (non-commercial, research only): QED (research only,cite), TED2013 (BY-NC-ND), TED2020(BY-NC-ND)

Some of these non-clear and non-free are also part of OPUS corpora, thus could be used in data source "OPUS".

## Source list

OPUS (O?, citing)
	Trained on data from the Opus.
	
	Broad, unknown datasets from OPUS. It is not clear which models of the corpora were used; thus it is not clear what is license restriction of used data.
	Would be helpful to gather all licenses of all sources to find the 'most strict license'.

	Please, cite the following LREC 2012 paper when using OPUS and also acknowledge corpus-specific references as specified in the resource-specific information and documentation!

	The judge dismissed the case on that count, ruling that the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph in the sense of the license, but rather a collective work. Since the atlas was not a derivative work of the photograph, Kappa Map Group did not need to license the entire atlas under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license.

# Overview

For these two models I see that they were trained also on data that is for non-commercial and research purposes only from TED talks:
English-Russian, Russian-English
One model does not have anything in the README: Spanish-Portugese

For the rest it is complicated:

1) models usually do not provide list of source or license of data, instead they provide needed citations required by source data, which is not always pointing to data. For example they refer to publication emnlp-2020-main which is not pointing to any data.

2) most of models state that they used "Data compiled by Opus" or "OPUS-MT" which may be various data components of OPUS corpora; OPUS contains also non-free data for example TED-talks or WikiMatrix and it is not known if it was or wasn't trained on it; But they state that model data are trained on a permissive license "CC-BY 4.0" so we can expect that it used only free data.

3) about half of language models are trained on WikiExtract, WikiMatrix data which has license CC-BY-SA saying "share with same license" but from my findings this applies only if we would be doing derivative of the work (use models to generate our new models), not when we do "collective work" on top of the models.
